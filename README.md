Going through a call with a friend with 20 years js experience who got oblitareted when it comes to React experience.

# API

An application programming interface is a computing interface that defines interactions between multiple software intermediaries.

# Apollo

React Apollo allows you to fetch data from your GraphQL server and use it in building complex and reactive UIs using the React framework. ... In the browser, in React Native, or in Node. js when you want to do server-side rendering.

# Fetch API, fetch request

The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses.

# GraphQL

GraphQL is an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs, and a runtime for fulfilling queries with existing data.

# Render prop

The term “render prop” refers to a technique for sharing code between React components using a prop whose value is a function. A component with a render prop takes a function that returns a React element and calls it instead of implementing its own render logic.

# React functions vs Classes

First of all, the clear difference is the syntax. Just like in their names, a functional component is just a plain JavaScript function that returns JSX. A class component is a JavaScript class that extends React. Component which has a render method. This function is a valid React component because it accepts a single “props” (which stands for properties) object argument with data and returns a React element. We call such components “function components” because they are literally JavaScript functions.

# React lifecycle

Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases. The three phases are: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.

React Redux is the official React binding for Redux. It lets your React components read data from a Redux store, and dispatch actions to the store to update data.

# React Router

React Router is a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application. IE Website URL navigation in a single page application.

# React State

React components has a built-in state object. The state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component. When the state object changes, the component re-renders.

# React Hooks

They let you use state and other React features without writing a class

# Serverless

Serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model in which the cloud provider allocates machine resources on demand, taking care of the servers on behalf of the their customers.

# Serverless function

A serverless function is a programmatic function written by a software developer for a single purpose.

# SPA
